# nginx role

This role has been created for this test.

NGinx is going to be installed from nginx repository, and we are going to add a vhost to the machine and start and enable nginx at boot.

This role should be taken as imcomplete as the vhost addition is only going to work for a reserve proxy.
I could have taken some roles on ansible galaxy, but it was a bit too much complete/complicate for a simple reverse proxy configuration.
